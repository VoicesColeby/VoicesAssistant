Function
This tool automates the process of inviting talent on the Voices.com platform. It can be used to send invitations in bulk to a specific job based on a pre-filtered list of talent. The tool's primary function is to replicate human behavior to avoid detection and ensure a smooth, reliable automation process. It handles the full workflow from navigating the search results to submitting the final invitation form within a modal dialog.

Input
START_URL (string): The URL of the talent search results page. This is the starting point for the automation.

JOB_QUERY (string): A unique identifier for the job, typically a job number (e.g., #818314) or a distinctive part of the job title. This is used to select the correct job from the dropdown menu within the invitation modal.

DEBUG_URL (string): The Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) URL to connect to an existing Chrome browser session. This is an internal configuration detail for the automation environment.

Capabilities
Full Automation: Can process multiple talent cards across multiple pages of search results.

Human-like Interaction: Includes randomized delays between steps and clicks (human_delay, step_pause, invite_pause) to mimic human behavior and prevent anti-bot measures from blocking the script.

Robust Navigation: Uses specific and reliable locators to interact with elements like the main invite button, the dropdown menu, and the modal dialog.

Dynamic Element Handling: Successfully handles dynamic elements within the invitation modal, such as the Choices.js job selection dropdown, by correctly scoping locators to the parent modal.

Error and Result Reporting: Provides clear logging for each action and reports the final status of each invitation as success, already invited, skipped, or failed.

Limitations
Requires a manual setup step to start the Chrome browser in a specific debugging mode before the script can run.

The JOB_QUERY must be a unique match to a job in the dropdown list for the script to function correctly.

The script is designed for the specific HTML structure of the Voices.com talent search page. Changes to the website's front-end could cause the script to fail.
